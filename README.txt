# Speedate

Speedate is a Gamejam 2013 Entry and was written in under 48 hours by myself, with graphics by a friend. It uses the Underscore.js, RequireJS and jQuery libraries and it uses the DOM rather than canvas for graphics.

The theme for the Game Jam was "Heartbeat". We chose to make a dating card game, a cross between Poker and Master mind. The objective of the game is to win as many hearts as possible, and if you play your cards right, find a soulmate.

You do this my listening to what the girl tells you, throwing cards that you think dont match onto the table and keeping cards that do match. At the end of the round your cards are shown and if you are compatible, she will give you her phone number or her heart.
